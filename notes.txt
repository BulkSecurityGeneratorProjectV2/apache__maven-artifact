Maven Artifact is supposed to be a general artifact mechanism for retrieving, installing, and deploying artifacts
to repositories. Maven Artifact was originally decoupled from Maven proper and as such carries a lot of baggage
which prevents it from being used generally and carries many notions that are very specific to Maven itself. Artifacts
currently have a notion of scope, classifiers, and behavioral attributes such as whether scopes should be inherited.
For any mechanism to work generally these baked in notions need to be removed, vetted, and then made compatible with
notions currently in Maven. A list of things that should not be in the Artifact:

 * scope
 * classifier
 * dependency filter
 * dependency trail
 * resolved
 * released
 * optional
 * available versions

These are all attributes of the target system

*Removal of the ArtifactFactory

 I have removed the factory and left only a small set of constructors (which I would like to reduce to one) so that you
 have a valid artifact after construction. I have also started to hide the VersionRange creation. You just pass in
 a string and the constructor for the DefaultArtifact will do the right thing. This will ultimately need to be more
 pluggable as different versioning strategies happen. But variations of the theme like Maven, OSGi, will have their
 own subclasses and tools to operate on the graphs of dependencies.
